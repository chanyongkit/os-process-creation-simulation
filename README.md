# os-process-creation-simulation
This objective of this project is to simulate the process creation of an operating system using CPU scheduling, main and virtual management algorithms using C# Windows Forms Application. 

CPU Scheduling:
* FCFS
* Priority Queue

Main Memory Management:
* First-Fit
* Best-Fit
* Worst-Fit

Virtual Memory Management:
* FIFO
* LRU
