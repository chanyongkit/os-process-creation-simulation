# os-process-creation-simulation
This objective of this project was to simulate the process creation of an operating system using CPU scheduling, main and virtual management algorithms over C#.

The following are simulated:
1.CPU Scheduling
* FCFS
* Priority Queue

2.Main Memory Management
* First-Fit
* Best-Fit
* Worst-Fit

3.Virtual Memory Management:
* FIFO
* LRU
